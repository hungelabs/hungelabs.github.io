### Hi friends! 
This wiki is just getting started, but I think it'd be cool to lay out some ground work for where I (and the rest of the team) are trying to go.

As it stands, I have a couple goals I want to get done before I turn our contributors loose on the wiki.
 - Get our base pages and resources set. 
 - - This would be all the nav links, contribution pages, any readme stuff, all the important shit. Even a "not done yet" page is better than a 404.
 - Directory Structure
 - - This is more of a note for me, but I need to actually get all the wiki pages organized under the right folders and shit so it's not a massive mess.
 - Documentation and contribution rules!
 - - Our contributors need to know how to actually contribute, so a guide is in order. It'd also be good to set some ground rules.
 - Bookkeeping
 - - I've got some work to do clean up the repo before it's fully live, it's a little cluttered rn

 Definitely some other stuff I'm not thinking about rn but that's the size of it. Hopefully we can get started with all this stuff soon (next week?), I've been kinda busy..

 with love,
