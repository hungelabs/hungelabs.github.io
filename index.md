# Hi there!
{: style="text-align: center;"}
If you're a weird coffee person, you're probably in the right place. This wiki was created to serve as a hub for all things coffee, from entry-level machine shootouts to custom water.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
<!-- ***Wherever you are on your coffee journey, we're glad to have you!*** -->
<!-- {: style="text-align: center;"} -->
If you're new to the whole specialty thing, we have an awesome [Getting Started](/knowledgebase/guide-beginners/getting-started-1-intro) guide that can help you figure out what kind of coffee makes you the most excited.

If you've got a great idea (or if you saw a typo!) and you'd like to help this wiki grow, head over to our [Contribution](/meta/orphaned/contribute) page!

This wiki was born out of the James Hoffmann patreon community, but isn't in any way sponsored or endorsed by Hoffmann. We're just a bunch of nerds who thought this would be a cool project :)
If you want to chat about the wiki but aren't a Hoffmann patreon, there's a [Hunge Labs Discord](https://discord.gg/2bkDE3FjHg) you can come hang out in!
