From seeing thousands of dollars of equipment online to nuanced (and at times, pretentious) flavor descriptors, specialty can appear as something of a walled garden.
This guide has been written with the express purpose of tearing down those walls. It does not assume any experience with coffee or sensory assessment, and aims to demystify the world of specialty in an approachable and friendly way.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with Specialty Coffee - Pt. 2</title><link>https://hungelabs.github.io/getting-started/what-is-coffee/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jun 2022 00:42:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://hungelabs.github.io/getting-started/what-is-coffee/</guid><description>Coffee - the plant In a strictly literal sense, brewing coffee is the steeping of a roasted seed harvested from a plant in the genus coffea. This genus contains several cultivated species, most commonly coffea arabica and coffea canephora, known as Arabica and Robusta respectively. Rarer are species such as stenophylla, liberica, and eugenioides, but coffea contains over 120 known species.

However, the term strength is a misnomer - in the world of specialty coffee, strength refers to a measurable property of the brew unrelated to roast level.
Specifically, strength describes the concentration of coffee compounds in water.</description></item></channel></rss>
