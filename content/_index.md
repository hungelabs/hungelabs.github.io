## Hi there! This should show up in the preview

If you're a weird coffee person, you're probably in the right place. This wiki was created to serve as a hub for all things coffee, from entry-level machine shootouts to custom water.

If you're new to the whole specialty thing, we have an awesome [Getting Started]({{< ref "getting-started/" >}}) guide that can help you figure out what kind of coffee makes you the most excited.

If you've got a great idea (or if you saw a typo!) and you'd like to help this wiki grow, head over to our [Contribution]({{< ref "contributing.md" >}}) page!

This wiki was born out of the James Hoffmann patreon community, but isn't in any way sponsored or endorsed by Hoffmann. We're just a bunch of nerds who thought this would be a cool project :)
If you want to chat about the wiki but aren't a Hoffmann patreon, there's a [Hunge Labs Discord](https://discord.gg/2bkDE3FjHg) you can come hang out in!
