## Words are important.
To learn about specialty coffee is to embark on a journey of discovery.
To make the process of exploration and discussion easier, the community has generally agreed on a specific way of describing coffee in taste and in method.
This article is an attempt to detail this language and some of its deeper complexities, and to shed some light on the inner workings of the specialty coffee industry.


## What is coffee?
At a strictly literal sense, brewing coffee is the steeping of a roasted seed harvested from a plant in the genus *coffea*. 
This genus contains several cultivated species, most commonly *coffea arabica* and *coffea canephora*, known as Arabica and Robusta respectively.
Less commonly, this genus includes species such as [*stenophylla*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGL7LtgC_0I), [*liberica*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_yCroVNGgs), and [*egenioides*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl1udZphV3k) but contains over 120 known species.

Historically, Robusta has been the staple of coffee consumption world-wide due to the higher yeild, easier cultivation, and climate-tolerant genetics.
However, the more recent cultivation and trade of Arabica has swept the coffee market, now representing roughly 60% of all coffee sale.
Arabica has gained dominance due to several factors, but the most pertinant is its quality in the cup. It is generally sweeter and more complex, with higher acidity and lower body than Robusta.
As the specialty market moved away from intense italian-style dark roasted coffee, Arabica found the spotlight as the industry's superstar.
Within the last decade or so, a small portion of the market has been working to [re-introduce higher quality robusta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qiwccma8Hs).

## What makes specialty coffee special?

### Objective perception 
At the forefront of the press for ever increasing quality and marketability, the [Specialty Coffee Association (SCA)](https://sca.coffee/) and [World Coffee Reaserch (WCR)](https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/) developed a grading system to weight different aspects of coffee's nuanced flavors.
In an effort to standardize the process for determining a coffee's perceptual quality, a scoring system was implemented. 
This system rates coffees based on several characteristics, including uniformity of flavor, body, acidity, defect, and more.
On a 0-100 scale from worst to absolute perfection, any coffee with a grade higher than 80 is considered to be specialty.
This scoring system works well as a general indicator of quality, and its asociated [flavor wheel](https://notbadcoffee.com/flavor-wheel-en/) can be a good tool for discovery and exploration of flavor, but is not without its faults.

### An imperfect system
In its development, much of the SCA and WCR language and implementation was writen by and for western tastes, and localization efforts are a relatively recent development.

The ethical history of the coffee industry is a troubled one, but is far too complex to delve into in this guide. 

## A brief guide to coffee terminology

### Coffee Roast Levels and Strength
In the broader world, it is common to describe coffee roast levels (light, medium, dark, french, etc) with a "strength" value, associating darker roasts with stronger brews.
However, the term strength is a misnomer - in the world of specialty coffee, strength refers to a measureable property of the brew unrelated to roast level.
Specifically, strength describes the concentration of coffee compounds in water. This is a phenomonon you will likely have already experienced - a straight espresso has higher strength than an americano or drip coffee.
This **intensity** of flavor, *not the flavor itself* is what describes strength. Flavor, acidic, sweet, or bitter, is handled by Extraction.

### Coffee extraction: the basics
If you've done much reaserch into specialty coffee, you'll likely have heard this word tossed around a great deal. 
*What does it mean, and why should you care?*

Extraction of coffee, while a complex topic, can be boiled down to a simple idea: 
> In the presence of water, certain compounds in coffee will be drawn from the ground coffee into the water, lending their flavor to the brewed coffee.

These compounds will leach at different rates, and these differences in extraction create a changing flavor profile.
Without going too far into extraction theory, the basic order of extraction is as follows:
- Sour, salty (Acids, fats, and salts)
- Sweet, complex fruits & florals (Complex aeromatics, simple sugars)
- Bitter, dry / astringent (Fibers, complex sugars)

If an extraction process is stopped too early, it will result in an unpleasent acidity often described as "battery acid".
Too high of an extraction and your coffee will be bitter and hollow.
With the tools we will cover in the next page of this guide, you will learn to "Dial in" - finding the window between under and over extraction, affording you the best-tasting brew.
