## Words are important.
To learn about specialty coffee is to embark on a journey. 
To make the process of exploration and discussion easier, the community has generally agreed on a specific way of describing coffee - in taste and in method.
This article is an attempt to detail this language and some of its deeper complexities, unraveling some of the apparent pretention surrounding specialty.

## What is coffee?
At a strictly literal sense, coffee is a baked seed harvested from a plant in the genus *coffea*. 
This genus contains several cultivated species, nost commonly *coffea arabica* and *coffea canephora*, known as Arabica and Robusta respectively.
Less commonly, this genus includes species such as [*stenophylla*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGL7LtgC_0I), [*liberica*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_yCroVNGgs), and [*egenioides*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl1udZphV3k) but contains over 120 known species.

Historically, Robusta has been the staple of coffee consumption world-wide due to the higher yeild, easier cultivation, and climate-tolerant genetics.
However, the more recent cultivation and trade of Arabica has swept the coffee market, representing roughly 60% of all coffee sale.
Arabica has gained dominance due to several factors, but the most pertinant is its quality in the cup. It is generally sweeter and more complex, with higher acidity and lower body than Robusta.
As the specialty market moved away from intense italian-style dark roasted coffee, Arabica found the spotlight as the industry's superstar.
Within the last decade or so, a small portion of the market has been working to [re-introduce higher quality robusta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qiwccma8Hs).

## What makes specialty coffee special?
At the forefront of the press for ever increasing quality and marketability, the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) developed a grading system to weight different aspects of coffee's nuanced flavors.
In an effort to standardize the process for determining a coffee's perceptual quality, a scoring system was implemented. 
On a 0-100 scale from worst to absolute perfection, any coffee with a grade higher than 80 is considered to be specialty.
This scoring system works well as a general indicator of quality, and its asociated [flavor wheel](https://notbadcoffee.com/flavor-wheel-en/) can be a good tool for discovery and exploration of flavor, but is not without its faults.

### An imperfect system
In its development, much of its language and implementation was localized to western markets, and localization efforts are a relatively recent development.

### Coffee Roast Levels and Strength
In the broader world, it is common to describe coffee roast levels (light, medium, dark, french, etc) with a "strength" value, associating darker roasts with stronger brews.
However, the term strength is a misnomer - in the world of specialty coffee, strength refers to a measureable property of the bew unrelated to roast level.
Specifically, strength describes the concentration of coffee compounds in water. This is a phenomonon you will likely have already experienced - drip coffee has less "punch" than a straight espresso.
This intensity of flavor, *not the flavor itself* is what describes strength. Flavor, acidic, sweet, or bitter, is handled by Extraction.


### Coffee extraction: the basics
If you've done much reaserch into specialty coffee, you'll likely have heard this word tossed around a great deal. 
*What does it mean, and why should you care?*

Extraction of coffee, while a complex topic, can be boiled down to a simple idea: 
> In the presence of water, certain compounds in coffee will be drawn from the ground coffee into the water, lending their flavor to the brewed coffee.

These compounds will leach at different rates, and these differences in speed create an extraction profile.
Without going too far into extraction theory, the basic order of extraction is as follows:
- Sour, salty (Acids, fats, and salts)
- Sweet, complex fruits & florals (Complex aeromatics, simple sugars)
- Bitter, dry / astringent (Fibers, complex sugars)

If an extraction process is stopped too early, it will result in an unpleasent acidity often described as "battery acid".
Too high of an extraction and your coffee will be bitter and hollow.
