# - A quick note -
Getting into specialty coffee can seem incredibly daunting at first glance. From seeing thousands of dollars of equipment online to nuanced (and at times, pretentious) flavor descriptors, specialty can appear as something of a walled garden.

This guide has been written with the express purpose of tearing down those walls. It does not assume any experience with coffee or sensory assessment, and aims to demystify the world of specialty in an approachable and friendly way.

As you dive into this craft and its community, it’s important to remember - coffee is an exploration and a journey, and the only real goal is to have fun. Don’t sweat the details, and don’t be afraid to do things your own way. If you’re enjoying yourself, you’re doing it right.

A brief disclosure before we begin; *this wiki is not finished, and at least for a while there will be stubs, dead links, and malformed pages.* We’re actively expanding it, and these issues will be fixed in time. For now though, if you run into an issue, we’re probably working on it. **That said, don’t hesitate to reach out to us!** Check out our [Contact](/meta/orphaned/contribute) page.
